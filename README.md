# BIRD FEEDER: Biometric Identification and Research-based Distribution Framework for Environmental Enrichment and Data-Enabled Ecological Research

## Overview
BIRD FEEDER, a collaborative effort between Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, Prescott Campus (ERAU-PC), and the University of Georgia (UGA), epitomizes a multidisciplinary, multi-university initiative. This project, partially supported by a grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF), aims to create a bird feeder that is a cost-effective and solar-powered while engineered to detect, weigh, and selectively grant or deny access to food for specific bird species whose migratory patterns we wish to study. It merges technology with wildlife conservation, leveraging the diverse expertise of ERAU-PC’s engineering departments and UGA’s Warnell School of Forestry and Natural Resources.
